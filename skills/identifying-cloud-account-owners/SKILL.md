# Identifying Cloud Account Owners

## When to Use

- A suspicious artifact, log, or document needs structured analysis.
- An alert requires confirmation from the underlying data.
- A report or hand-off needs reproducible findings rather than prose.

**Do not use** for rotating cloud credentials - use `rotating-cloud-credentials`.

## Prerequisites

- The artifact, copied to an evidence directory with a SHA-256 recorded.
- The parser or toolchain for the artifact type, and a known-good sample to validate it.
- The schema the output must satisfy.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Preserve the artifact

Hash it before analysis and work on a copy.

### Step 2: Parse

Use the artifact-specific parser; record the tool and version.

### Step 3: Extract

Pull the fields that matter for the investigation, keeping context for each.

### Step 4: Normalize

Map to the shared schema, de-duplicate, and mark confidence.

### Step 5: Report

Write findings with the evidence path, the commands used, and the limits of the analysis.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```powershell
# Active Directory
Disable-ADAccount -Identity jdoe
Get-ADUser -Identity jdoe -Properties LastLogonDate,MemberOf | Select-Object Name,LastLogonDate,MemberOf
Revoke-AzureADUserAllRefreshToken -ObjectId jdoe@example.com
```

```bash
# Microsoft Entra ID: disable the account and revoke sessions
az ad user update --id user@example.com --account-enabled false
az rest --method POST --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/user@example.com/revokeSignInSessions"
```

```bash
# Okta: suspend the account and revoke sessions
curl -X POST "https://<org>.okta.com/api/v1/users/<user_id>/lifecycle/suspend" \
  -H "Authorization: SSWS $OKTA_TOKEN"
curl -X DELETE "https://<org>.okta.com/api/v1/users/<user_id>/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: SSWS $OKTA_TOKEN"
```

## Verification

- The artifact hash in the report matches the source.
- A second run produces the same findings.
- Every finding cites the field or byte range it came from.
- The report states what the analysis could not see.

## Common Pitfalls

- Analyzing the original instead of a copy.
- Claiming content that is encrypted or truncated.
- Dropping context when de-duplicating.
- No tool version, so the result is not reproducible.
