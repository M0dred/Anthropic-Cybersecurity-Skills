# Verifying Containment Actions with CrowdStrike

## When to Use

- A suspicious artifact, log, or document needs structured analysis.
- An alert requires confirmation from the underlying data.
- A report or hand-off needs reproducible findings rather than prose.

**Do not use** for blocking files with crowdstrike - use `blocking-files-with-crowdstrike`.

## Prerequisites

- The artifact, copied to an evidence directory with a SHA-256 recorded.
- The parser or toolchain for the artifact type, and a known-good sample to validate it.
- The schema the output must satisfy.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Preserve the artifact

Hash it before analysis and work on a copy.

### Step 2: Parse

Use the artifact-specific parser; record the tool and version.

### Step 3: Extract

Pull the fields that matter for the investigation, keeping context for each.

### Step 4: Normalize

Map to the shared schema, de-duplicate, and mark confidence.

### Step 5: Report

Write findings with the evidence path, the commands used, and the limits of the analysis.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```bash
# CrowdStrike Falcon
curl -X POST "https://api.crowdstrike.com/devices/entities/devices-actions/v2?action_name=contain" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ids":["<device_id>"]}'
curl "https://api.crowdstrike.com/devices/queries/devices/v1?filter=hostname:'WEB-01'" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CS_TOKEN"
```

## Verification

- The artifact hash in the report matches the source.
- A second run produces the same findings.
- Every finding cites the field or byte range it came from.
- The report states what the analysis could not see.

## Common Pitfalls

- Analyzing the original instead of a copy.
- Claiming content that is encrypted or truncated.
- Dropping context when de-duplicating.
- No tool version, so the result is not reproducible.
