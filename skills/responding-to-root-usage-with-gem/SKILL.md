# Responding To Root Usage with Gem

## When to Use

- The environment uses one of: Gem.
- responding to root usage with gem must be executed through a vendor API or console.
- An incident or audit needs a reproducible, vendor-specific record.

**Do not use** for the vendor-neutral procedure; use the matching generic skill.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the vendor console or API, and a credential with the required scope.
- The object identifier (host, account, resource, or indicator) and its provenance.
- A rollback path and a ticket for the change.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm entry criteria

Verify the facts that justify this phase.

### Step 2: Plan

List the actions, the owner, and the expected effect.

### Step 3: Execute

Perform the actions, capturing output and timestamps.

### Step 4: Verify

Confirm the phase objective is met.

### Step 5: Record

Write the decision log and the exit criteria.

## Vendor Variants

### Gem Handle Alert for Root Usage

Source pack: Gem

Find all the users who might’ve performed the actions using root (via the source IP), validate it with them using Slack and resolve the alert in case these actions were planned.

## Platform Commands

```bash
# Generic REST call with a bearer token
curl -sS -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Verification

- The phase objective is met and evidenced.
- Every action has an owner and a timestamp.
- The decision log explains the choices.
- The next phase's entry criteria are stated.

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping the evidence capture.
- Moving phases without exit criteria.
- No decision log.
- Losing the incident timeline.
