# Detecting Lookalike Sender Domains

## When to Use

- A threat report or incident suggests lookalike sender domains may be present elsewhere.
- A detection needs validation against historical telemetry.
- A proactive hunt is scheduled for the environment.

**Do not use** for blocking malicious domains - use `blocking-malicious-domains`.

## Prerequisites

- Query access to the relevant telemetry: SIEM, EDR, cloud audit logs, or network.
- The data retention window and the field map for each source.
- A hypothesis with a falsifiable test.

## Workflow

### Step 1: State the hypothesis

Write what you expect to see if the activity is present, and what would prove it absent.

### Step 2: Translate to queries

Write one query per telemetry source, with the fields and time window explicit.

### Step 3: Run and triage

Execute, de-duplicate, and rank hits by confidence and asset criticality.

### Step 4: Pivot

For each confirmed hit, pivot on the entity, the technique, and the infrastructure.

### Step 5: Document

Record the queries, the hit counts, the false positives, and the coverage gaps.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```powershell
# Microsoft 365
Get-MessageTrace -SenderAddress attacker@evil.example -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)
New-ComplianceSearch -Name "INC-1234" -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery 'from:attacker@evil.example'
Start-ComplianceSearch -Identity "INC-1234"
New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName "INC-1234" -Purge -PurgeType SoftDelete
```

```bash
# Proofpoint TAP / mail gateway
curl "https://tap.proofpoint.com/v2/siem/messages/blocked?interval=2026-08-30T00:00:00Z/2026-08-31T00:00:00Z" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $PP_AUTH"
```

```bash
# PAN-OS: add the value to an External Dynamic List and deny it
set external-list blocklist type ip
set external-list blocklist url https://internal.example.com/blocklist.txt
set rulebase security rules deny-blocklist source [ blocklist ]
set rulebase security rules deny-blocklist action deny
commit
```

```bash
# Cloudflare: block at the edge
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CF_ACCOUNT/firewall/access_rules/rules" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"mode":"block","configuration":{"target":"ip","value":"203.0.113.10"},"notes":"INC-1234"}'
```

```bash
# BIND RPZ: sinkhole the domain
cat >> /etc/bind/db.rpz <<'EOF'
evil.example.  IN  CNAME  .
EOF
rndc reload

# Unbound: local block
echo 'local-zone: "evil.example." always_nxdomain' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
unbound-control reload
```

## Verification

- The queries are saved and rerunnable.
- Hit counts reconcile with a manual spot check.
- False positives are explained, not silently dropped.
- Coverage gaps are stated explicitly.

## Common Pitfalls

- Hunting without a hypothesis.
- Querying only one telemetry source.
- Ignoring retention limits.
- Reporting hits without triage.
