name: checking-ioc-prevalence
description: >-
  The queries the analytics module to receive the prevalence of an IOC. Supported IOCs. Measures how widely an indicator appears in the estate. Use when an alert names indicator prevalence and context is needed before a decision, or when a block or escalation depends on indicator prevalence reputation. Keywords: checking, ioc, prevalence, enrichment, reputation, threat intelligence. Do not use for checking email domains against blocklists - use `checking-email-domains-against-blocklists`.

# Checking Ioc Prevalence

## When to Use

- A detection names indicator prevalence and the analyst needs context before deciding.
- A block or escalation decision needs provenance, not a hunch.
- An incident timeline needs first-seen, last-seen, and ownership data.

**Do not use** for checking email domains against blocklists - use `checking-email-domains-against-blocklists`.

## Prerequisites

- API access to the sources you enable, and a cache directory.
- An allowlist of known-good values so shared infrastructure is not misread.
- The source's rate limits, so a batch does not exhaust the quota.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate the value

Reject private, reserved, malformed, or out-of-scope entries before any API call.

### Step 2: Query the sources

Run the enabled sources in parallel where possible, and record failures as failures rather than as clean results.

### Step 3: Normalize

Map each source's fields into one schema with the source name attached to every value.

### Step 4: Score confidence

Combine independent signals with explicit weights; cap the score when fewer than two sources respond.

### Step 5: Hand off

Attach the record to the incident and pass the decision to the containment or escalation skill.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```bash
# Generic REST call with a bearer token
curl -sS -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Verification

- Every enabled source appears in either the success or failure list.
- The confidence score is reproducible from the component signals.
- Cached values carry the original lookup timestamp.
- No credentials appear in the output.

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating no reports as clean.
- Ignoring shared infrastructure.
- Burning the daily quota on a /24.
- Using stale reputation without recording the lookup time.
