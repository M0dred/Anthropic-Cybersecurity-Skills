name: detonating-urls-in-sandbox
description: >-
  Detonate URL through one or more active integrations that support URL detonation. Submits a URL to URL-scanning sandboxes and captures the redirect chain. Use when URLs in a sandbox must be parsed for evidence, or when an alert needs confirmation from URLs in a sandbox. Keywords: detonating, urls, sandbox, analysis, parsing, incident response. Do not use for detonating files in sandbox - use `detonating-files-in-sandbox`.

# Detonating URLs in Sandbox

## When to Use

- A suspicious artifact, log, or document needs structured analysis.
- An alert requires confirmation from the underlying data.
- A report or hand-off needs reproducible findings rather than prose.

**Do not use** for detonating files in sandbox - use `detonating-files-in-sandbox`.

## Prerequisites

- The artifact, copied to an evidence directory with a SHA-256 recorded.
- The parser or toolchain for the artifact type, and a known-good sample to validate it.
- The schema the output must satisfy.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Preserve the artifact

Hash it before analysis and work on a copy.

### Step 2: Parse

Use the artifact-specific parser; record the tool and version.

### Step 3: Extract

Pull the fields that matter for the investigation, keeping context for each.

### Step 4: Normalize

Map to the shared schema, de-duplicate, and mark confidence.

### Step 5: Report

Write findings with the evidence path, the commands used, and the limits of the analysis.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```bash
# PAN-OS: add the value to an External Dynamic List and deny it
set external-list blocklist type ip
set external-list blocklist url https://internal.example.com/blocklist.txt
set rulebase security rules deny-blocklist source [ blocklist ]
set rulebase security rules deny-blocklist action deny
commit
```

```bash
# Cloudflare: block at the edge
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CF_ACCOUNT/firewall/access_rules/rules" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"mode":"block","configuration":{"target":"ip","value":"203.0.113.10"},"notes":"INC-1234"}'
```

```bash
# BIND RPZ: sinkhole the domain
cat >> /etc/bind/db.rpz <<'EOF'
evil.example.  IN  CNAME  .
EOF
rndc reload

# Unbound: local block
echo 'local-zone: "evil.example." always_nxdomain' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
unbound-control reload
```

```bash
curl "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/<sha256>" -H "x-apikey: $VT_API_KEY"
curl -X POST "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files" -H "x-apikey: $VT_API_KEY" -F "file=@sample.bin"
```

## Verification

- The artifact hash in the report matches the source.
- A second run produces the same findings.
- Every finding cites the field or byte range it came from.
- The report states what the analysis could not see.

## Common Pitfalls

- Analyzing the original instead of a copy.
- Claiming content that is encrypted or truncated.
- Dropping context when de-duplicating.
- No tool version, so the result is not reproducible.
