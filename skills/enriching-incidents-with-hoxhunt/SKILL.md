# Enriching Incidents with Hoxhunt

## When to Use

- The environment uses one of: Hoxhunt.
- enriching incidents with hoxhunt must be executed through a vendor API or console.
- An incident or audit needs a reproducible, vendor-specific record.

**Do not use** for the vendor-neutral procedure; use the matching generic skill.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the vendor console or API, and a credential with the required scope.
- The object identifier (host, account, resource, or indicator) and its provenance.
- A rollback path and a ticket for the change.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate the value

Reject private, reserved, malformed, or out-of-scope entries before any API call.

### Step 2: Query the sources

Run the enabled sources in parallel where possible, and record failures as failures rather than as clean results.

### Step 3: Normalize

Map each source's fields into one schema with the source name attached to every value.

### Step 4: Score confidence

Combine independent signals with explicit weights; cap the score when fewer than two sources respond.

### Step 5: Hand off

Attach the record to the incident and pass the decision to the containment or escalation skill.

## Vendor Variants

### Hoxhunt - Enrich Incident

Source pack: Hoxhunt

Enriches the incidents pulled from Hoxhunt with additional information.

## Platform Commands

```bash
# Generic REST call with a bearer token
curl -sS -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Verification

- Every enabled source appears in either the success or failure list.
- The confidence score is reproducible from the component signals.
- Cached values carry the original lookup timestamp.
- No credentials appear in the output.

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating no reports as clean.
- Ignoring shared infrastructure.
- Burning the daily quota on a /24.
- Using stale reputation without recording the lookup time.
