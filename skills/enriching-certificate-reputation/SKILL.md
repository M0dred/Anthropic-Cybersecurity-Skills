  Enrich and calculate reputation of a Certificate indicator. Adds certificate transparency, issuer, and reputation. Use when an alert names certificate reputation and context is needed before a decision, or when a block or escalation depends on certificate reputation reputation.

# Enriching Certificate Reputation

## When to Use

- A detection names certificate reputation and the analyst needs context before deciding.
- A block or escalation decision needs provenance, not a hunch.
- An incident timeline needs first-seen, last-seen, and ownership data.

**Do not use** for enriching cloud assets - use `enriching-cloud-assets`.

## Prerequisites

- API access to the sources you enable, and a cache directory.
- An allowlist of known-good values so shared infrastructure is not misread.
- The source's rate limits, so a batch does not exhaust the quota.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate the value

Reject private, reserved, malformed, or out-of-scope entries before any API call.

### Step 2: Query the sources

Run the enabled sources in parallel where possible, and record failures as failures rather than as clean results.

### Step 3: Normalize

Map each source's fields into one schema with the source name attached to every value.

### Step 4: Score confidence

Combine independent signals with explicit weights; cap the score when fewer than two sources respond.

### Step 5: Hand off

Attach the record to the incident and pass the decision to the containment or escalation skill.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```bash
# Generic REST call with a bearer token
curl -sS -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Verification

- Every enabled source appears in either the success or failure list.
- The confidence score is reproducible from the component signals.
- Cached values carry the original lookup timestamp.
- No credentials appear in the output.

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating no reports as clean.
- Ignoring shared infrastructure.
- Burning the daily quota on a /24.
- Using stale reputation without recording the lookup time.
