# Scanning Assets with Digital Defense

## When to Use

- The environment uses one of: Digital Defense Frontline VM.
- scanning assets with digital defense must be executed through a vendor API or console.
- An incident or audit needs a reproducible, vendor-specific record.

**Do not use** for the vendor-neutral procedure; use the matching generic skill.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the vendor console or API, and a credential with the required scope.
- The object identifier (host, account, resource, or indicator) and its provenance.
- A rollback path and a ticket for the change.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm the finding

Reproduce the misconfiguration from the platform's own API or CLI.

### Step 2: Plan the change

Generate the exact command or template diff, and review it before applying.

### Step 3: Apply

Execute with the least privilege that accomplishes the fix, and capture the response.

### Step 4: Verify

Re-read the resource state and confirm it matches the expected secure state.

### Step 5: Record

Write the change, the approver, the verification, and the rollback.

## Vendor Variants

### Digital Defense FrontlineVM - Scan Asset Not Recently Scanned

Source pack: Digital Defense Frontline VM

Pulls IP addresses from the detail value of an incident and check if that asset has been scanned within the past 60 days. If not then it will then prompt the user to perform a scan on the asset.

## Platform Commands

```bash
# Generic REST call with a bearer token
curl -sS -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Verification

- The resource state matches the expected secure state.
- The change did not break dependent services.
- The rollback is documented and tested.
- The finding is closed with the evidence attached.

## Common Pitfalls

- Applying a fix without a dry run.
- Breaking a dependent service.
- Fixing one resource and leaving the pattern elsewhere.
- No rollback for a change that cannot be reversed.
