description: >-
  This v2 is used inside the phishing flow. The inputs in this version do not use labels and also allow the user to supply an email brand. Note: You must have the necessary permissions in your email service to execute a global search. To retrieve the email. Retrieves the full thread and attachments. Use when the original email thread must be collected as evidence, or when volatile data about the original email thread must be preserved. Keywords: retrieving, original, email, thread, acquisition, forensics, phishing defense. Do not use for retrieving original emails from gateway - use `retrieving-original-emails-from-gateway`.

# Retrieving Original Email Thread

## When to Use

- An incident requires forensic evidence from a host or capture point.
- A review or legal process needs a defensible acquisition.
- Volatile data must be preserved before containment or reboot.

**Do not use** for retrieving original emails from gateway - use `retrieving-original-emails-from-gateway`.

## Prerequisites

- Authorization and scope for the acquisition.
- A target directory with enough space, and a write blocker where required.
- The transport: local, WinRM, SSH, or an agent.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Authorize and scope

Record who approved the acquisition and what is in scope.

### Step 2: Capture volatile data first

Memory, processes, sockets, and logged-on users before anything changes.

### Step 3: Capture persistent data

Registry, MFT, event logs, and file system metadata.

### Step 4: Hash and record

SHA-256 every artifact and record the tool, version, and time.

### Step 5: Transfer and store

Move to evidence storage, verify the hash after transfer, and restrict access.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```powershell
# Microsoft 365
Get-MessageTrace -SenderAddress attacker@evil.example -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)
New-ComplianceSearch -Name "INC-1234" -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery 'from:attacker@evil.example'
Start-ComplianceSearch -Identity "INC-1234"
New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName "INC-1234" -Purge -PurgeType SoftDelete
```

```bash
# Proofpoint TAP / mail gateway
curl "https://tap.proofpoint.com/v2/siem/messages/blocked?interval=2026-08-30T00:00:00Z/2026-08-31T00:00:00Z" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $PP_AUTH"
```

## Verification

- Every artifact has a hash that matches after transfer.
- The chain-of-custody form is complete.
- The acquisition did not alter the source more than documented.
- The evidence is stored with access controls.

## Common Pitfalls

- Rebooting before memory capture.
- Writing to the evidence disk.
- Missing the hash after transfer.
- Acquiring beyond the authorized scope.
