description: >-
  When an unknown executable, DLL, or macro attempts to run on a Windows or Mac endpoint, the XDR agent uses local analysis to determine if it is likely to be malware. Local analysis uses a static set of pattern-matching rules that inspect multiple file. Triages alerts from on-host static analysis of unknown executables. Use when an alert names local-analysis alerts and the scope is unknown, or when a timeline is needed for local-analysis alerts. Keywords: investigating, local, analysis, alerts, investigation, triage, endpoint security. Do not use for investigating masquerading alerts - use `investigating-masquerading-alerts`.

# Investigating Local Analysis Alerts

## When to Use

- An alert names local-analysis alerts and the scope is not yet known.
- An incident needs a timeline and a verdict before containment.
- A review challenges whether the original conclusion was supported.

**Do not use** for investigating masquerading alerts - use `investigating-masquerading-alerts`.

## Prerequisites

- Read access to the relevant telemetry and asset inventory.
- The entity identifiers: user, host, IP, or application.
- A case or ticket to attach evidence to.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope the entity

Resolve the identifier to all of its identities and assets.

### Step 2: Collect evidence

Pull authentication, process, network, and cloud audit events for the window.

### Step 3: Build the timeline

Order events, resolve time zones, and mark the first and last malicious action.

### Step 4: Test hypotheses

Distinguish the observed facts from the inference, and check alternative explanations.

### Step 5: Conclude

State the verdict, the confidence, and the recommended containment.

## Platform Commands

The commands below are the platform-native equivalents for this procedure.

```bash
# Generic REST call with a bearer token
curl -sS -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Verification

- Every timeline entry has a source and a timestamp.
- The verdict distinguishes facts from inference.
- Alternative explanations are addressed.
- The evidence is attached to the case.

## Common Pitfalls

- Confirmation bias toward the first alert.
- Mixing time zones in the timeline.
- Treating a single log line as proof.
- Closing without checking lateral movement.
