# Scanning Domains with C2sec

## When to Use

- The environment uses one of: C2sec irisk.
- scanning domains with c2sec must be executed through a vendor API or console.
- An incident or audit needs a reproducible, vendor-specific record.

**Do not use** for the vendor-neutral procedure; use the matching generic skill.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the vendor console or API, and a credential with the required scope.
- The object identifier (host, account, resource, or indicator) and its provenance.
- A rollback path and a ticket for the change.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm the finding

Reproduce the misconfiguration from the platform's own API or CLI.

### Step 2: Plan the change

Generate the exact command or template diff, and review it before applying.

### Step 3: Apply

Execute with the least privilege that accomplishes the fix, and capture the response.

### Step 4: Verify

Re-read the resource state and confirm it matches the expected secure state.

### Step 5: Record

Write the change, the approver, the verification, and the rollback.

## Vendor Variants

### C2SEC-Domain Scan

Source pack: C2sec irisk

Launches a C2sec scan by domain name and waits for the scan to finish by polling its status in pre-defined intervals.

Inputs:

- `DomainName`: The domain name.
- `interval`: How often the polling command should run (in minutes).
- `timeout`: The amount of time to wait before a timeout occurs (in minutes).

## Platform Commands

```bash
# PAN-OS: add the value to an External Dynamic List and deny it
set external-list blocklist type ip
set external-list blocklist url https://internal.example.com/blocklist.txt
set rulebase security rules deny-blocklist source [ blocklist ]
set rulebase security rules deny-blocklist action deny
commit
```

```bash
# Cloudflare: block at the edge
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CF_ACCOUNT/firewall/access_rules/rules" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"mode":"block","configuration":{"target":"ip","value":"203.0.113.10"},"notes":"INC-1234"}'
```

```bash
# BIND RPZ: sinkhole the domain
cat >> /etc/bind/db.rpz <<'EOF'
evil.example.  IN  CNAME  .
EOF
rndc reload

# Unbound: local block
echo 'local-zone: "evil.example." always_nxdomain' >> /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
unbound-control reload
```

## Verification

- The resource state matches the expected secure state.
- The change did not break dependent services.
- The rollback is documented and tested.
- The finding is closed with the evidence attached.

## Common Pitfalls

- Applying a fix without a dry run.
- Breaking a dependent service.
- Fixing one resource and leaving the pattern elsewhere.
- No rollback for a change that cannot be reversed.
