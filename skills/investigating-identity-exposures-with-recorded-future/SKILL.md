# Investigating Identity Exposures with Recorded Future

## When to Use

- The environment uses one of: Recorded Future Identity.
- investigating identity exposures with recorded future must be executed through a vendor API or console.
- An incident or audit needs a reproducible, vendor-specific record.

**Do not use** for the vendor-neutral procedure; use the matching generic skill.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the vendor console or API, and a credential with the required scope.
- The object identifier (host, account, resource, or indicator) and its provenance.
- A rollback path and a ticket for the change.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope the entity

Resolve the identifier to all of its identities and assets.

### Step 2: Collect evidence

Pull authentication, process, network, and cloud audit events for the window.

### Step 3: Build the timeline

Order events, resolve time zones, and mark the first and last malicious action.

### Step 4: Test hypotheses

Distinguish the observed facts from the inference, and check alternative explanations.

### Step 5: Conclude

State the verdict, the confidence, and the recommended containment.

## Vendor Variants

### Recorded Future - Identity Exposure

Source pack: Recorded Future Identity

Was developed as a template response when an Identity Exposure Playbook Alert has been triggered.

## Platform Commands

```bash
# Microsoft Entra ID: disable the account and revoke sessions
az ad user update --id user@example.com --account-enabled false
az rest --method POST --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/user@example.com/revokeSignInSessions"
```

```powershell
# Active Directory
Disable-ADAccount -Identity jdoe
Get-ADUser -Identity jdoe -Properties LastLogonDate,MemberOf | Select-Object Name,LastLogonDate,MemberOf
Revoke-AzureADUserAllRefreshToken -ObjectId jdoe@example.com
```

## Verification

- Every timeline entry has a source and a timestamp.
- The verdict distinguishes facts from inference.
- Alternative explanations are addressed.
- The evidence is attached to the case.

## Common Pitfalls

- Confirmation bias toward the first alert.
- Mixing time zones in the timeline.
- Treating a single log line as proof.
- Closing without checking lateral movement.
